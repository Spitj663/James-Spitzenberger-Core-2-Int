    James Spitzenberger-Questionnaire
  </h1>

  <p>
    1. Describe your previous experience with coding
    <ol>
      <li>What classes have you already taken where you were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS?</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>I took Core 1 interaction last semsester. This was my first ever experience with coding. We covered HTML and CSS but no JS.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>What parts of the class resonated with you?</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>It was nice finally getting to learn code as I feel like its important to at least have a decent understanding of it in our field. So just the experience of learning was fairly exciting.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>What parts were most confusing?</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Things were just rushed in class as there was so much to learn. I feel like I still dont have a good understanding of HTML and CSS semantics and syntax like how to properly even use something simple like ordered lists or span or ID tags and whatever else that I dont know.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    2. How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? 
    If so, why? What can I do in this class to help reduce this anxiety?

    <ul>
      <li>Im exqually excited as I am anxious. I really want to know how to code, like I said before i think
        its very important. However it seems like the more I learn the harder it gets. In my last class, my teacher
        discouraged asking questions because he wanted to make sure we covered all the content for that day. I get
        where he was coming from but I think its more important to ask questions, it doesnt just help the individual,
        it also helps the whole class. I also do really well with video tutorials, thats how I learn best because I can take 
        my own time. If you ever have any video reccomendations on the topics we cover that would be much appreciated!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    3. How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?

    <ul>
      <li>If i get good at it, then I can picture quite a lot. I always hear about how people program
        scripts for plugins in their browser to help make certain tasks quicker. I see coding and generative
        art which sometimes seems so beautiful to me. Plus I think the better you are at coding the more hireable
        youd be and the more money you could potentially make. It could never hurt to learn this and only help I think.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    4. What text editor do you prefer to use?
    <ul>
      <li>Ive only ever used VS code but from what ive gathered it seems to be like a good one? I really dont care 
        whatever editor makes all of this easier then im down.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    5. Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.
    <ul>
      <li>I used github for the first time last semester. From my understanding its a site to publish and save your 
        sites that youve coded. Its a bit social and you can view others as well. You can share your project to be edited 
        by teams of people too i believe.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    6. Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this relationship. “Bonus points” for creative analogies.
    <ul>
      <li>Like you said in class, if youre building a house, HTML is like the concrete foundation and wood 
        framework. CSS is the paint you put on the walls and the style of furniture you put within. JS is the 
        wiring and plumbing and heating that makes the whole house actually function. I understand this analogy on 
        a base level but ive never actually explored JS so I dont actually know how it really works.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    7. Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there’s 6 levels of heading tags).

    <h2>
      A) Sushi
    </h2>

    <h3>
      B) Bahn Mi
    </h3>

    <h4>
      C) Bananna
    </h4>

    <h5>
      D) Ice cream (soft serve)
    </h5>

    <h6>
      E) Eggs bennedict
    </h6>
  </p>

  <p>
    8. Create an unordered list and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related websites. Include a paragraph  on each site describing why it is important to you.

      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.waltervanbeirendonck.com/"> WALTER</a> </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tameemsankari/?hl=en"> Tameem Sankari</a> </li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    9. Insert an image that brings you joy to the page. Make sure the image includes alt text that describes the image.
    <h3>My cats</h3>
    <img width="550" src="cats.jpeg" alt="cute cat picture">

  </p>

  <p>
    10. Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).

    <p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsowHW0t7CA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>Not sure why the video wont load :( </p>
  </p>

  <p>
    11. Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to maintain proper indentation.

    <main>MAIN

      <section>
        SECTION 
        
        <div>
          DIV 

          <p>
            PARAGRAPH 

            <span>
              SPAN 

            </span>
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>
  </p>

  <p>
    12. Create an ordered list of the top 5 countries you’d like to visit. Within each country, create another ordered list of the top cities you’d like to visit in that country. Maintain proper indentation and make sure you nest your ordered lists properly.

    <ol>

      <li>Japan
        <ol>
          <li>Kyoto</li>
          <li>Tokyo</li>
          <li>Nara</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Switzerland
        <ol>
          <li>Geneva </li>
          <li>Bern</li>
          <li>Interlaken</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>South Korea
        <ol>
          <li>Seoul</li>
          <li>Busan</li>
          <li>Changwon</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Norway
        <ol>
          <li>Oslo</li>
          <li>Bergen</li>
          <li>Fredrikstad</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Taiwan
        <ol>
          <li>Taipei</li>
          <li>Tainan</li>
          <li>Hsinchu</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    13. Use pre tags to create a simple concrete poetry version of a Haiku or other poem you write. The poem should represent how you feel at this moment.

    <pre>
      Im coding in class
          One day I hope to be good
              For now, I am bad
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    14. Write an HTML comment that is hidden from the browser, but displays in the code.
    <!-- SECRET MESSAGE! -->
  </p>

  <p>
    15. Create an unordered list of at least 6 musical artists you like to listen to. Add a class to each list item that matches the genre of music of that artist.

    <ul>

      <li class="fishmans">Fishmans</li>
      <li class="deathgrips">Death Grips</li>
      <li class="milesdavis">Miles Davis</li>
      <li class="gecs">100 Gecs</li>
      <li class="beach-house">Beach House</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    16. Describe the difference between block, inline-block and inline elements.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Not really sure to be honest. very fuzzy on all of that.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    17. Use CSS to style the musical genre classes you added in question 9. Give each genre a color and personality using CSS.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Done! Look above :) 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    18. Use any CSS knowledge you currently have to style your questionnaire in a unique way. Make sure to update the font to something other than the default (use the font-family css property).

    <ul>
      <li>
        Done again, changed the font of the body and background color.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    19. In a script tag, use the console.log function to write a message to the console (Cmd+Opt+U). 
    Tell me something interesting about yourself.

    <ul>
      <li>Ive never used this tag and would definitley be down for a class tutorial on it if you think 
        its a good thing to know!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    20. Add a button to your HTML file and make it do something when clicked using JavaScript.
    <ul>
      <li>I dont even know where to begin with JS. I really hope we can dig into it this semester though.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
